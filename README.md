- Hey there! I'm Cassidy, an Economics major and Data Science minor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I'm passionate about coding and am currently diving into languages like R Studio, Python, and SQL. When I'm not knee-deep in data, you can find me soaking up the sun at the beach or catching my favorite bands at concerts. I'm dedicated to leveraging my skills in data science to create meaningful projects, and I hope you enjoy exploring them on my GitHub profile.
